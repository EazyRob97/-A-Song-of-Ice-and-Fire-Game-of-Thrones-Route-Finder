# A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire-Game-of-Thrones-Route-Finder
The objective of this Project was to create an interactive application that could search for and retrieve various routes between specified towns/cities in the “known world” as depicted in George R R Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire book series, which is the basis for the TV series Game of Thrones. This was a team based Project.
